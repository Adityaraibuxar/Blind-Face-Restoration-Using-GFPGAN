# Blind-Face-Restoration-Using GFPGAN(Generative Facial Prior - Generative Style Gan)
Blind face restoration aims at recovering high-quality
faces from the low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation, such as low-resolution,
noise , blur, compression artifacts , etc.
When applied to real-world scenarios, it becomes more
challenging, due to more complicated degradation, diverse
poses and expressions.
GAN-GAN composes of two deep networks, the generator, and the discriminator.
